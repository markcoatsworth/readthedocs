<!--l. 7--><p class="indent" >   The HTCondor Job Monitor is a Java application designed to allow users to view user log files. It is identified as
the Contrib Module called HTCondor Log Viewer.
<!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >   To view a user log file, select it using the open file command in the File menu. After the file is parsed, it will be
visually represented. Each horizontal line represents an individual job. The x-axis is time. Whether a job is
running at a particular time is represented by its color at that time &#8211; white for running, black for idle.
For example, a job which appears predominantly white has made efficient progress, whereas a job
which appears predominantly black has received an inordinately small proportion of computational
time.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">10.3.1   </span> <a 
 id="x82-59400010.3.1"></a>Transition States</h4>
<!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >A transition state is the state of a job at any time. It is called a transition, because it is defined by the two events
which bookmark it. There are two basic transition states: running and idle. An idle job typically is a job which has
just been submitted into the HTCondor pool and is waiting to be matched with an appropriate machine or a job
which has vacated from a machine and has been returned to the pool. A running job, by contrast, is a job which is
making active progress.
<!--l. 35--><p class="indent" >   Advanced users may want a visual distinction between two types of running transitions: <span class="emph">goodput</span> or <span class="emph">badput</span>.
                                                                                         

                                                                                         
Goodput is the transition state preceding an eventual job completion or checkpoint. Badput is the transition state
preceding a non-checkpointed eviction event. Note that badput is potentially a misleading nomenclature; a job
which does not produce a checkpoint by the HTCondor program may produce the checkpoint itself or make progress
in some other way. To view these two transition as distinct transitions, select the appropriate option from the
"View" menu.

 id="x82-59500010.3.2"></a>Events</h4>
<!--l. 50--><p class="noindent" >There are two basic kinds of events: checkpoint events and error events. Plus, advanced users can ask to see more
events.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">10.3.3   </span> <a 
 id="x82-59600010.3.3"></a>Selecting Jobs</h4>
<!--l. 56--><p class="noindent" >To view any arbitrary selection of jobs in a job file, use the job selector tool. Jobs appear visually
by order of appearance within the actual text log file. For example, the log file might contain jobs
775.1, 775.2, 775.3, 775.4, and 775.5, which appear in that order. A user who wishes to see only jobs
775.2 and 775.5 can select only these two jobs in the job selector tool and click the "Ok" or "Apply"
button. The job selector supports double clicking; double click on any single job to see it drawn in
isolation.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">10.3.4   </span> <a 
 id="x82-59700010.3.4"></a>Zooming</h4>
<!--l. 63--><p class="noindent" >To view a small area of the log file, zoom in on the area which you would like to see in greater detail. You can zoom
in, out and do a full zoom. A full zoom redraws the log file in its entirety. For example, if you have zoomed in very
close and would like to go all the way back out, you could do so with a succession of zoom outs or with one full
zoom.
<!--l. 66--><p class="indent" >   There is a difference between using the menu driven zooming and the mouse driven zooming. The menu driven
zooming will recenter itself around the current center, whereas mouse driven zooming will recenter itself
(as much as possible) around the mouse click. To help you re-find the clicked area, a box will flash
after the zoom. This is called the "zoom finder" and it can be turned off in the zoom menu if you
prefer.
