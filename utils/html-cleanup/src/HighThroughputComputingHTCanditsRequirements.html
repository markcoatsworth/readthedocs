<!--l. 7--><p class="indent" >   For many research and engineering projects, the quality of the research or the product is heavily dependent
upon the quantity of computing cycles available. It is not uncommon to find problems that require
weeks or months of computation to solve. Scientists and engineers engaged in this sort of work need a
computing environment that delivers large amounts of computational power over a long period of time.
Such an environment is called a High-Throughput Computing (HTC) environment. <a 
 id="dx4-4003"></a><a 
 id="dx4-4004"></a> In contrast, High
Performance Computing (HPC) <a 
 id="dx4-4005"></a><a 
 id="dx4-4006"></a> environments deliver a tremendous amount of compute power over a short
period of time. HPC environments are often measured in terms of FLoating point Operations Per
Second (FLOPS). A growing community is not concerned about operations per second, but operations
per month or per year. Their problems are of a much larger scale. They are more interested in how
many jobs they can complete over a long period of time instead of how fast an individual job can
complete.
<!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >   The key to HTC is to efficiently harness the use of all available resources. Years ago, the engineering and
scientific community relied on a large, centralized mainframe or a supercomputer to do computational work. A large
                                                                                         

                                                                                         
number of individuals and groups needed to pool their financial resources to afford such a machine. Users had to
wait for their turn on the mainframe, and they had a limited amount of time allocated. While this
environment was inconvenient for users, the utilization of the mainframe was high; it was busy nearly all the
time.
<!--l. 44--><p class="indent" >   As computers became smaller, faster, and cheaper, users moved away from centralized mainframes and
purchased personal desktop workstations and PCs. An individual or small group could afford a computing resource
that was available whenever they wanted it. The personal computer is slower than the large centralized
machine, but it provides exclusive access. Now, instead of one giant computer for a large institution,
there may be hundreds or thousands of personal computers. This is an environment of distributed
ownership, <a 
 id="dx4-4007"></a>where individuals throughout an organization own their own resources. The total computational
power of the institution as a whole may rise dramatically as the result of such a change, but because
of distributed ownership, individuals have not been able to capitalize on the institutional growth of
computing power. And, while distributed ownership is more convenient for the users, the utilization of
the computing power is lower. Many personal desktop machines sit idle for very long periods of time
while their owners are busy doing other things (such as being away at lunch, in meetings, or at home
sleeping).
