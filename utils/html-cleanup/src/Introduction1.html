<!--l. 5--><p class="indent" >   This is the HTCondor Administrator&#8217;s Manual. Its purpose is to aid in the installation and administration of an
HTCondor pool. For help on using HTCondor, see the HTCondor User&#8217;s Manual.
<!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >   An HTCondor pool <a 
 id="dx29-148001"></a><a 
 id="dx29-148002"></a> is comprised of a single machine which serves as the <span class="emph">central manager</span>, <a 
 id="dx29-148003"></a>and an arbitrary
number of other machines that have joined the pool. Conceptually, the pool is a collection of resources (machines)
and resource requests (jobs). The role of HTCondor is to match waiting requests with available resources. Every
part of HTCondor sends periodic updates to the central manager, the centralized repository of information about
the state of the pool. Periodically, the central manager assesses the current state of the pool and tries to match
pending requests with the appropriate resources.
<!--l. 25--><p class="indent" >   Each resource has an owner, <a 
 id="dx29-148004"></a><a 
 id="dx29-148005"></a> the one who sets the policy for the use of the machine. This person has absolute
power over the use of the machine, and HTCondor goes out of its way to minimize the impact on this owner caused
by HTCondor. It is up to the resource owner to define a policy for when HTCondor requests will serviced and when
they will be denied.
<!--l. 36--><p class="indent" >   Each resource request has an owner as well: the user who submitted the job. These people want HTCondor to
provide as many CPU cycles as possible for their work. Often the interests of the resource owners are in conflict with
the interests of the resource requesters. The job of the HTCondor administrator is to configure the HTCondor pool
to find the happy medium that keeps both resource owners and users of resources satisfied. The purpose of this
manual is to relate the mechanisms that HTCondor provides to enable the administrator to find this happy
medium.

 id="x29-1490003.1.1"></a>The Different Roles a Machine Can Play</h4>
<!--l. 51--><p class="noindent" >Every machine in an HTCondor pool can serve a variety of roles. Most machines serve more than one role
simultaneously. Certain roles can only be performed by a single machine in the pool. The following list
describes what these roles are and what resources are required on the machine that is providing that
service:
<a 
 id="dx29-149001"></a>
<a 
 id="dx29-149002"></a>
     <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
Central Manager </dt><dd 
class="description">There can be only one central manager for the pool. This machine is the collector of
     information, and the negotiator between resources and resource requests. These two halves of the
     central manager&#8217;s responsibility are performed by separate daemons, so it would be possible to have
     different machines providing those two services. However, normally they both live on the same machine.
     This machine plays a very important part in the HTCondor pool and should be reliable. If this machine
     crashes, no further matchmaking can be performed within the HTCondor system, although all current
     matches remain in effect until they are broken by either party involved in the match. Therefore, choose
     for central manager a machine that is likely to be up and running all the time, or at least one that will
     be rebooted quickly if something goes wrong. The central manager will ideally have a good network
     connection to all the machines in the pool, since these pool machines all send updates over the network
     to the central manager.

     </dd><dt class="description">
Execute </dt><dd 
class="description">Any machine in the pool, including the central manager, can be configured as to whether or not
     it should execute HTCondor jobs. Obviously, some of the machines will have to serve this function, or
     the pool will not be useful. Being an execute machine does not require lots of resources. About the
     only resource that might matter is disk space. In general the more resources a machine has in terms of
     swap space, memory, number of CPUs, the larger variety of resource requests it can serve.
<a 
 id="dx29-149005"></a>
<a 
 id="dx29-149006"></a>
     </dd><dt class="description">
Submit </dt><dd 
class="description">Any machine in the pool, including the central manager, can be configured as to whether or not
     it should allow HTCondor jobs to be submitted. The resource requirements for a submit machine are
     actually much greater than the resource requirements for an execute machine. First, every submitted job
     that is currently running on a remote machine runs a process on the submit machine. As a result, lots
     of running jobs will need a fair amount of swap space and/or real memory. In addition, the checkpoint
     files from standard universe jobs are stored on the local disk of the submit machine. If these jobs have
     a large memory image and there are a lot of them, the submit machine will need a lot of disk space to
     hold these files. This disk space requirement can be somewhat alleviated by using a checkpoint server,
     however the binaries of the jobs are still stored on the submit machine.
<a 
 id="dx29-149007"></a>
<a 
 id="dx29-149008"></a>
                                                                                         

                                                                                         
     </dd><dt class="description">
Checkpoint Server </dt><dd 
class="description">Machines in the pool can be configured to act as checkpoint servers. This is optional,
     and is not part of the standard HTCondor binary distribution. A checkpoint server is a machine that
     stores checkpoint files for sets of jobs. A machine with this role should have lots of disk space and a
     good network connection to the rest of the pool, as the traffic can be quite heavy.
