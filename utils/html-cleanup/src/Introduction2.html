<!--l. 5--><p class="indent" >   A goal of grid computing is to allow the utilization of resources that span many administrative domains. An
HTCondor pool often includes resources owned and controlled by many different people. Yet collaborating
researchers from different organizations may not find it feasible to combine all of their computers into
a single, large HTCondor pool. HTCondor shines in grid computing, continuing to evolve with the
field.
<!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >   Due to the field&#8217;s rapid evolution, HTCondor has its own native mechanisms for grid computing as well as
developing interactions with other grid systems.
<!--l. 20--><p class="indent" >   <span class="emph">Flocking</span> is a native mechanism that allows HTCondor jobs submitted from within one pool to execute on
another, separate HTCondor pool. Flocking is enabled by configuration within each of the pools. An advantage to
flocking is that jobs migrate from one pool to another based on the availability of machines to execute jobs. When
the local HTCondor pool is not able to run the job (due to a lack of currently available machines), the job flocks to
another pool. A second advantage to using flocking is that the user (who submits the job) does not need to be
concerned with any aspects of the job. The user&#8217;s submit description file (and the job&#8217;s <span class="textbf">universe</span><a 
 id="dx54-450001"></a>) are independent
of the flocking mechanism.
<!--l. 36--><p class="indent" >   Other forms of grid computing are enabled by using the <span class="textbf">grid</span> <span class="textbf">universe</span> and further specified with the
<span class="textbf">grid_type</span>. For any HTCondor job, the job is submitted on a machine in the local HTCondor pool. The
location where it is executed is identified as the remote machine or remote resource. These various grid
computing mechanisms offered by HTCondor are distinguished by the software running on the remote
resource.
<!--l. 47--><p class="indent" >   When HTCondor is running on the remote resource, and the desired grid computing mechanism is to move the
job from the local pool&#8217;s job queue to the remote pool&#8217;s job queue, it is called HTCondor-C. The job is submitted
using the <span class="textbf">grid</span> <span class="textbf">universe</span>, and the <span class="textbf">grid_type</span> is <span class="textbf">condor</span>. HTCondor-C jobs have the advantage that once the job
has moved to the remote pool&#8217;s job queue, a network partition does not affect the execution of the job. A
further advantage of HTCondor-C jobs is that the <span class="textbf">universe</span> of the job at the remote resource is not
restricted.
<!--l. 62--><p class="indent" >   When other middleware is running on the remote resource, such as Globus, HTCondor can still submit and
manage jobs to be executed on remote resources. A <span class="textbf">grid</span> <span class="textbf">universe</span> job, with a <span class="textbf">grid_type</span> of <span class="textbf">gt2</span> or <span class="textbf">gt5</span>
calls on Globus software to execute the job on a remote resource. Like HTCondor-C jobs, a network
partition does not affect the execution of the job. The remote resource must have Globus software
running.

<!--l. 76--><p class="indent" >   HTCondor permits the temporary addition of a Globus-controlled resource to a local pool. This is called <span class="emph">glidein</span>.
Globus software is utilized to execute HTCondor daemons on the remote resource. The remote resource appears to
                                                                                         

                                                                                         
have joined the local HTCondor pool. A user submitting a job may then explicitly specify the remote resource as the
execution site of a job.
<!--l. 85--><p class="indent" >   Starting with HTCondor Version 6.7.0, the <span class="textbf">grid</span> universe replaces the <span class="textbf">globus</span> universe. Further
specification of a <span class="textbf">grid</span> universe job is done within the <span class="textbf">grid_resource</span><a 
 id="dx54-450004"></a> command in a submit description
file.
