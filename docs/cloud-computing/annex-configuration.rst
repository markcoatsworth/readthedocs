============================

While the configuration macros in this section may be set by the
HTCondor administrator, they are intended for the user-specific HTCondor
configuration file (usually ~/.condor/user\_config). Although we
document every macro, we expect that users will generally only want to
change a few of them, listed in section `6.5.1 <#x67-5430006.5.1>`__;
the entries required in by *condor\_annex* in other sections will be
generated by its setup procedure.

Subsequent sections deal with logging (section
`6.5.2 <#x67-5440006.5.2>`__), are for expert users (section
`6.5.3 <#x67-5450006.5.3>`__), or for HTCondor developers (section
`6.5.4 <#x67-5460006.5.4>`__).

User Settings
-------------

 ``ANNEX_DEFAULT_AWS_REGION``
    The default region when using AWS. Defaults to ‘us-east-1’.
 ``ANNEX_DEFAULT_LEASE_DURATION``
    The duration of an annex if not specified on the command-line;
    specified in seconds. Defaults to 50 minutes.
 ``ANNEX_DEFAULT_UNCLAIMED_TIMEOUT``
    How long an annex instances should stay idle before shutting down;
    specified in seconds. Defaults to 15 minutes.
 ``ANNEX_DEFAULT_ODI_KEY_NAME``
    The name of the SSH key pair *condor\_annex* should use by default.
    No default.
 ``ANNEX_DEFAULT_ODI_INSTANCE_TYPE``
    The AWS instance type to use for on-demand instances if not
    specified. No default, but the *condor\_annex* setup procedure sets
    this to ‘m4.large’.
 ``ANNEX_DEFAULT_ODI_IMAGE_ID``
    The AWS AMI to use for on-demand instance if not specified. No
    default, but the *condor\_annex* setup procedure sets this to
    ‘ami-35b13223’.
 ``ANNEX_DEFAULT_SFR_CONFIG_FILE``
    The JSON configuration file use by *condor\_annex* when creating a
    Spot-based annex. No default.

Logging
-------

By default, running *condor\_annex* creates three logs: the
*condor\_annex* log, the annex GAHP log, and the annex audit log. The
default location for these logs is the same directory as the
user-specific HTCondor configuration file (usually
~/.condor/user\_config). *condor\_annex* sets the ``LOG`` macro to this
directory when reading its configuration.

The *condor\_annex* log is a daemon-style log. It is configured as if
*condor\_annex* were a daemon with subsystem type ``ANNEX``; see section
`3.5.2 <ConfigurationMacros.html#x33-1890003.5.2>`__ for details.

*condor\_annex* uses special helper programs, called GAHPs, to interact
with the different cloud services. These programs do their own logging,
writing to the annex GAHP log. The annex GAHP log is configured as if it
were a daemon, but with subsystem type ``ANNEX_GAHP``; see section
`3.5.2 <ConfigurationMacros.html#x33-1890003.5.2>`__ for details.

The annex audit log records two lines for each invocation of
*condor\_annex*: the command as issued and the results as returned. The
location of the audit log is set by ``ANNEX_AUDIT_LOG`` , which is the
``AUDIT``-level log for the ``ANNEX`` subsystem; see
``<SUBSYS>_<LEVEL>_LOG``
(`3.5.2 <ConfigurationMacros.html#x33-1890003.5.2>`__) for details.
Because annex creation commands typically make extensive use of values
set in configuration, *condor\_annex* will write the configuration it
used for annex creation commands into the audit log if ``ANNEX_DEBUG``
includes ``D_AUDIT:2``.

Expert Settings
---------------

 ``ANNEX_DEFAULT_EC2_URL``
    The AWS EC2 endpoint that *condor\_annex* should use. Defaults to
    ‘https://ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com’.
 ``ANNEX_DEFAULT_CWE_URL``
    The AWS CloudWatch Events endpoint that *condor\_annex* should use.
    Defaults to ‘https://events.us-east-1.amazonaws.com’.
 ``ANNEX_DEFAULT_LAMBDA_URL``
    The AWS Lambda endpoint that *condor\_annex* should use. Defaults to
    ‘https://lambda.us-east-1.amazonaws.com’.
 ``ANNEX_DEFAULT_S3_URL``
    The AWS S3 endpoint that *condor\_annex* should use. Defaults to
    ‘https://s3.amazonaws.com’.
 ``ANNEX_DEFAULT_CF_URL``
    The AWS CloudFormation endpoint that *condor\_annex* should use.
    Defaults to ‘https://cloudformation.us-east-1.amazonaws.com’.
 ``ANNEX_DEFAULT_ACCESS_KEY_FILE``
    The full path to the AWS access key file *condor\_annex* should use.
    No default. If “FROM INSTANCE”, *condor\_annex* will assume it’s
    running on an EC2 instance and try to use that instance’s
    credentials.
 ``ANNEX_DEFAULT_SECRET_KEY_FILE``
    The full path to the AWS secret key file *condor\_annex* should use.
    No default. If “FROM INSTANCE”, *condor\_annex* will assume it’s
    running on an EC2 instance and try to use that instance’s
    credentials.
 ``ANNEX_DEFAULT_S3_BUCKET``
    A private S3 bucket that the ``ANNEX_DEFAULT_ACCESS_KEY_FILE`` and
    ``ANNEX_DEFAULT_SECRET_KEY_FILE`` may write to. No default.
 ``ANNEX_DEFAULT_ODI_SECURITY_GROUP_IDS``
    The default security group for on-demand annexes. Must permit
    inbound HTCondor (port 9618).

Developer Settings
------------------

 ``ANNEX_DEFAULT_CONNECTIVITY_FUNCTION_ARN``
    The name (or ARN) of the Lambda function on AWS which
    *condor\_annex* should use to check if the configured collector can
    be contacted from AWS.
 ``ANNEX_DEFAULT_ODI_INSTANCE_PROFILE_ARN``
    The ARN of the instance profile *condor\_annex* should use. No
    default.
 ``ANNEX_DEFAULT_ODI_LEASE_FUNCTION_ARN``
    The Lambda function which implements the lease (duration) for
    on-demand instances. No default.
 ``ANNEX_DEFAULT_SFR_LEASE_FUNCTION_ARN``
    The Lambda function which implements the lease (duration) for Spot
    instances. No default.
