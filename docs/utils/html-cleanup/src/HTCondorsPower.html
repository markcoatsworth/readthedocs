<!--l. 72--><p class="indent" >   HTCondor is a software system that creates a High-Throughput Computing (HTC) environment. It effectively
utilizes the computing power of workstations that communicate over a network. HTCondor can manage a dedicated
cluster of workstations. Its power comes from the ability to effectively harness non-dedicated, preexisting resources
under distributed ownership. <a 
 id="dx5-5001"></a>
<!--l. 82--><p class="indent" >   A user submits the job to HTCondor. HTCondor finds an available machine on the network and begins running
the job on that machine. HTCondor has the capability to detect that a machine running a HTCondor job is no
longer available (perhaps because the owner of the machine came back from lunch and started typing on
the keyboard). It can checkpoint <a 
 id="dx5-5002"></a>the job and move (migrate) <a 
 id="dx5-5003"></a>the jobs to a different machine which
would otherwise be idle. HTCondor continues the job on the new machine from precisely where it left
off.
<!--l. 96--><p class="indent" >   In those cases where HTCondor can checkpoint and migrate a job, HTCondor makes it easy to maximize the
number of machines which can run a job. In this case, there is no requirement for machines to share file systems (for
example, with NFS or AFS), so that machines across an entire enterprise can run a job, including machines in
different administrative domains.
<!--l. 104--><p class="indent" >   HTCondor can be a real time saver when a job must be run many (hundreds of) different times, <a 
 id="dx5-5004"></a>perhaps with
hundreds of different data sets. With one command, all of the hundreds of jobs are submitted to HTCondor.
Depending upon the number of machines in the HTCondor pool, dozens or even hundreds of otherwise idle machines
can be running the job at any given moment.
<!--l. 113--><p class="indent" >   HTCondor does not require an account (login) on machines where it runs a job. HTCondor can do this because
of its <span class="emph">remote system call</span> <a 
 id="dx5-5005"></a>technology, which traps library calls for such operations as reading or writing from disk
files. The calls are transmitted over the network to be performed on the machine where the job was
submitted.
<a 
 id="dx5-5006"></a>
<a 
 id="dx5-5007"></a>
<!--l. 125--><p class="indent" >   HTCondor provides powerful resource management by match-making resource <a 
 id="dx5-5008"></a>owners with resource consumers.
This is the cornerstone of a successful HTC environment. Other compute cluster resource management
systems attach properties to the job queues themselves, resulting in user confusion over which queue to
use as well as administrative hassle in constantly adding and editing queue properties to satisfy user
demands. HTCondor implements <span class="emph">ClassAds</span>, <a 
 id="dx5-5009"></a>a clean design that simplifies the user&#8217;s submission of
jobs.
                                                                                         

                                                                                         
<!--l. 140--><p class="indent" >   ClassAds work in a fashion similar to the newspaper classified advertising want-ads. All machines in the
HTCondor pool advertise their resource properties, both static and dynamic, such as available RAM
memory, CPU type, CPU speed, virtual memory size, physical location, and current load average, in a
<span class="emph">resource offer</span> ad. <a 
 id="dx5-5010"></a>A user specifies a <span class="emph">resource request</span> ad <a 
 id="dx5-5011"></a>when submitting a job. The request defines
both the required and a desired set of properties of the resource to run the job. HTCondor acts as a
broker by matching and ranking resource offer ads with resource request ads, making certain that all
requirements in both ads are satisfied. During this match-making process, HTCondor also considers several
layers of priority values: the priority the user assigned to the resource request ad, the priority of the
user which submitted the ad, and desire of machines in the pool to accept certain types of ads over
others.
