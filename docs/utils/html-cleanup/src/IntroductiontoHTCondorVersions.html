<!--l. 5--><p class="indent" >   This chapter provides descriptions of what features have been added or bugs fixed for each version of HTCondor.
The first section describes the HTCondor version numbering scheme, what the numbers mean, and what the
                                                                                         

                                                                                         
different <span class="emph">release series</span> are. The rest of the sections each describe a specific release series, and all the HTCondor
versions found in that series.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">11.1.1   </span> <a 
 id="x84-60100011.1.1"></a> HTCondor Version Number Scheme</h4>
<!--l. 17--><p class="noindent" >Starting with version 6.0.1, HTCondor adopted a new, hopefully easy to understand version numbering scheme. It
reflects the fact that HTCondor is both a production system and a research project. The numbering scheme was
primarily taken from the Linux kernel&#8217;s version numbering, so if you are familiar with that, it should seem quite
natural.
<!--l. 25--><p class="indent" >   There will usually be two HTCondor versions available at any given time, the <span class="emph">stable</span> version, and the
<span class="emph">development</span> version. Gone are the days of &#8220;patch level 3&#8221;, &#8220;beta2&#8221;, or any other random words in the version string.
All versions of HTCondor now have exactly three numbers, separated by &#8220;.&#8221;
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">The first number represents the major version number, and will change very infrequently.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span class="emph">The thing that determines whether a version of HTCondor is <span class="emph">stable</span> or <span class="emph">development</span> is the second digit.
     Even numbers represent stable versions, while odd numbers represent development versions.</span>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The final digit represents the minor version number, which defines a particular version in a given release
     series.
     </li></ul>
<!--l. 49--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">11.1.2   </span> <a 
 id="x84-60200011.1.2"></a>The Stable Release Series</h4>
<!--l. 52--><p class="noindent" >People expecting the stable, production HTCondor system should download the stable version, denoted
with an even number in the second digit of the version string. Most people are encouraged to use
this version. We will only offer our paid support for versions of HTCondor from the stable release
series.
<!--l. 60--><p class="indent" >   <span class="emph">On the stable series, new minor version releases will only be made for bug fixes and to support new platforms.</span> No
new features will be added to the stable series. People are encouraged to install new stable versions of HTCondor
when they appear, since they probably fix bugs you care about. Hopefully, there will not be many minor version
releases for any given stable series.
                                                                                         

                                                                                         
<!--l. 70--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">11.1.3   </span> <a 
 id="x84-60300011.1.3"></a> The Development Release Series</h4>
<!--l. 73--><p class="noindent" >Only people who are interested in the latest research, new features that haven&#8217;t been fully tested, etc, should
download the development version, denoted with an odd number in the second digit of the version
string. We will make a best effort to ensure that the development series will work, but we make no
guarantees.
<!--l. 80--><p class="indent" >   On the development series, new minor version releases will probably happen frequently. People should not feel
compelled to install new minor versions unless they know they want features or bug fixes from the newer
development version.
<!--l. 87--><p class="indent" >   <span class="emph">Most sites will probably never want to install a development version of HTCondor for any reason.</span> Only if you
know what you are doing (and like pain), or were explicitly instructed to do so by someone on the HTCondor Team,
should you install a development version at your site.
<!--l. 92--><p class="indent" >   After the feature set of the development series is satisfactory to the HTCondor Team, we will put a code freeze
in place, and from that point forward, only bug fixes will be made to that development series. When we have fully
tested this version, we will release a new stable series, resetting the minor version number, and start work on a new
development release from there.
