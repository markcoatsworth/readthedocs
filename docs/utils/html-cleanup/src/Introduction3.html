<!--l. 3--><p class="indent" >   To be clear, our concern throughout this chapter is with commercial services which rent computational resources over
the Internet at short notice and charge in small increments (by the minute or the hour). In 2016, the four largest such
services<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="ref60.html#fn1x7"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x59-498001f1"></a> 
were (in alphabetical order) Amazon Web Services (&#8216;AWS&#8217;), (Microsoft) Azure, Google Cloud Platform (&#8216;GCP&#8217;),
and (IBM) SoftLayer; as of version 8.7.8, the <span class="textit">condor_annex</span> tool supports only AWS. AWS can start booting a new
virtual machine as quickly as a few seconds after the request; barring hardware failure, you will be able to
continue renting that VM until you stop paying the hourly charge. The other cloud services are broadly
similar.
<!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >   If you already have access to the Grid, you may wonder why you would want to begin cloud computing. The
cloud services offer two major advantages over the Grid: first, cloud resources are typically available more quickly
and in greater quantity than from the Grid; and second, because cloud resources are virtual machines, they are
                                                                                         

                                                                                         
considerably more customizable than Grid resources. The major disadvantages are, of course, cost and complexity
(although we hope that <span class="textit">condor_annex</span> reduces the latter).
<!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >   We illustrate these advantages with what we anticipate will be the most common uses for <span class="textit">condor_annex</span>.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">6.1.1   </span> <a 
 id="x59-4990006.1.1"></a>Use Case: Deadlines</h4>
<!--l. 28--><p class="noindent" >With the ability to acquire computational resources in seconds or minutes and retain them for days or weeks, it
becomes possible to rapidly adjust the size &#8211; and cost &#8211; of an HTCondor pool. Giving this ability to the
end-user avoids the problems of deciding who will pay for expanding the pool and when to do so. We
anticipate that the usual cause for doing so will be deadlines; the end-user has the best knowledge of
their own deadlines and how much, in monetary terms, it&#8217;s worth to complete their work by that
deadline.
<!--l. 41--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">6.1.2   </span> <a 
 id="x59-5000006.1.2"></a>Use Case: Capabilities</h4>
<!--l. 43--><p class="noindent" >Cloud services may offer (virtual) hardware in configurations unavailable in the local pool, or in quantities that it
would be prohibitively expensive to provide on an on-going basis. Examples (from 2017) may include GPU-based
computation, or computations requiring a terabyte of main memory. A cloud service may also offer fast and
cloud-local storage for shared data, which may have substantial performance benefits for some workflows. Some
cloud providers (for example, AWS) have pre-populated this storage with common public datasets, to further ease
adoption.
<!--l. 52--><p class="indent" >   By using cloud resources, an HTCondor pool administrator may also experiment with or temporarily offer
different software and configurations. For example, a pool may be configured with a maximum job runtime, perhaps
to reduce the latency of fair-share adjustments or to protect against hung jobs. Adding cloud resources which
permit longer-running jobs may be the least-disruptive way to accomodate a user whose jobs need more
time.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">6.1.3   </span> <a 
 id="x59-5010006.1.3"></a>Use Case: Capacities</h4>
<!--l. 61--><p class="noindent" >It may be possible for an HTCondor administrator to lower the cost of their pool by increasing utilization and
meeting peak demand with cloud computing.
