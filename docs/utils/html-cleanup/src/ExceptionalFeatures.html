Checkpoint and Migration. </dt><dd 
class="description">Where programs can be linked with HTCondor libraries, users of HTCondor
     may be assured that their jobs will eventually complete, even in the ever changing environment that
     HTCondor utilizes. As a machine running a job submitted to HTCondor becomes unavailable, the
     job can be check pointed. <a 
 id="dx6-6001"></a>The job may continue after migrating <a 
 id="dx6-6002"></a>to another machine. HTCondor&#8217;s
     checkpoint feature <a 
 id="dx6-6003"></a>periodically checkpoints a job even in lieu of migration in order to safeguard the
     accumulated computation time on a job from being lost in the event of a system failure, such as the
     machine being shutdown or a crash.
     </dd><dt class="description">
Remote System Calls. </dt><dd 
class="description"><a 
 id="dx6-6004"></a> Despite  running  jobs  on  remote  machines,  the  HTCondor  standard  universe
     execution mode preserves the local execution environment via remote system calls. Users do not have
     to worry about making data files available to remote workstations or even obtaining a login account
     on remote workstations before HTCondor executes their programs there. The program behaves under
     HTCondor as if it were running as the user that submitted the job on the workstation where it was
     originally submitted, no matter on which machine it really ends up executing on.
     </dd><dt class="description">
No Changes Necessary to User&#8217;s Source Code. </dt><dd 
class="description">No       special       programming       is       required
     to use HTCondor. HTCondor is able to run non-interactive programs. The checkpoint and migration
     of programs by HTCondor is transparent and automatic, as is the use of remote system calls. If these
     facilities are desired, the user only re-links the program. The code is neither recompiled nor changed.
     </dd><dt class="description">
Pools of Machines can be Hooked Together. </dt><dd 
class="description">Flocking  is  a  feature  of  HTCondor  that  allows  jobs
     submitted within a first pool of HTCondor machines to execute on a second pool. The mechanism
     is flexible, following requests from the job submission, while allowing the second pool, or a subset of
     machines within the second pool to set policies over the conditions under which jobs are executed.
     </dd><dt class="description">
Jobs can be Ordered. </dt><dd 
class="description">The ordering of job execution required by dependencies among jobs in a set is
     easily handled. The set of jobs is specified using a directed acyclic graph, where each job is a node in
     the graph. Jobs are submitted to HTCondor following the dependencies given by the graph.
                                                                                         

                                                                                         
     </dd><dt class="description">
HTCondor Enables Grid Computing. </dt><dd 
class="description">As grid computing becomes a reality, HTCondor is already there.
     The technique of glidein allows jobs submitted to HTCondor to be executed on grid machines in various
     locations worldwide. As the details of grid computing evolve, so does HTCondor&#8217;s ability, starting with
     Globus-controlled resources.
     </dd><dt class="description">
Sensitive to the Desires of Machine Owners. </dt><dd 
class="description">The owner of a machine has complete priority over the
     use of the machine. An owner is generally happy to let others compute on the machine while it is idle,
     but wants it back promptly upon returning. The owner does not want to take special action to regain
     control. HTCondor handles this automatically.
     </dd><dt class="description">
ClassAds. </dt><dd 
class="description">The ClassAd mechanism <a 
 id="dx6-6005"></a>in HTCondor provides an extremely flexible, expressive framework for
     matchmaking resource requests with resource offers. Users can easily request both job requirements
     and job desires. For example, a user can require that a job run on a machine with 64 Mbytes of RAM,
     but state a preference for 128 Mbytes, if available. A workstation owner can state a preference that
     the workstation runs jobs from a specified set of users. The owner can also require that there be no
     interactive workstation activity detectable at certain hours before HTCondor could start a job. Job
     requirements/preferences and resource availability constraints can be described in terms of powerful
     expressions, resulting in HTCondor&#8217;s adaptation to nearly any desired policy.</dd></dl>
