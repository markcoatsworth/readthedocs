     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Fixed  a  bug  in  Python  plugin  support  for  the  <span class="textit">condor_collector</span>  that  would  result  in  the

<!--l. 674--><p class="noindent" >Bugs Fixed:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Fixed a bug that caused systems using cgroup memory limits to not properly reset the memory limit
     after the first use of a slot. The memory limit would get reused from the previous slot value. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6414" >(Ticket

     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Asking systemd to stop condor now allows the HTCondor daemons to properly clean up, instead of
     simply immediately sending a SIGKILL. As a result, HTCondor daemons stopped via systemd will no
     longer continue to appear alive with <span class="textit">condor_status</span>. <a

     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Change  the  default  value  of  STARTD_RECOMPUTE_DISK_FREE  to  false,  so  that  the  Disk
     attribute is mostly correct for partitionable slots. <a

     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Docker universe now sets the cgroup cpu-shares field to 100 times the number of requested cores, which

     </li>
     <li class="itemize">MOUNT_UNDER_SCRATCH when used in Docker universe can now be an expression, not just a

     of open sockets was more than 820 even though space was allocated for 1024 open sockets. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6425" >(Ticket
     #6425).</a>

href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6458" >(Ticket #6458).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span class="textit">condor_status</span> will now print longer lines when its output is redirected into a pipe, rather than its
     input coming from one. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6381" >(Ticket #6381).</a>
     </li>

     #6412).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Fixed   a   bug   that   caused   <span class="textit">condor_job_router_info</span>   to   crash   if   configuration   parameter

     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Fixed a bug in <span class="textit">condor_history</span> that caused it to print invalid XML or JSON syntax when reading from
     multiple history files. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6437" >(Ticket #6437).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Fixed a bug in the <span class="textit">condor_schedd</span> which resulted in the <span class="texttt">IsNoopJob</span> job attribute sometimes being
     ignored if the the value of this attribute was changed after the job was submitted. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6396" >(Ticket #6396).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Fixed a bug that rarely caused slurm jobs to be held. When slurm reports memory utilization and it
     is a multiple of 1024k, Slurm uses the &#8217;M&#8217; suffix. The parsing logic was extended to also interpret the
     &#8217;M&#8217;, &#8217;G&#8217;, &#8217;T&#8217;, and &#8217;P&#8217; suffixes for memory utilization. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6431" >(Ticket #6431).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The condor-bosco RPM ensures the <span class="textit">rsync</span> is installed as required by the Bosco scripts. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6439" >(Ticket #6439).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">To avoid unnecessary transfers when <span class="texttt">copy_to_spool</span> is set in the submit file, HTCondor no longer
     copies the executable to the local spool directory more than once for a cluster. <a

     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Fixed a bug that might cause the <span class="textit">condor_schedd</span> or other daemons to crash when logging on Linux to
     the syslog facility, and the <span class="textit">condor_reconfig</span> command was run. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6364" >(Ticket #6364).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Fixed a bug that prevented condor daemons from writing out a core file for debugging in the very
     unlikely event that one of them crashed. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6365" >(Ticket #6365).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Fixed a bug where the negotiator would make matches where the daemons involved did not share an

href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6351" >(Ticket #6351).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">HTCondor now works properly with systemd&#8217;s watchdog feature on all flavors of Linux. Previously,
     the <span class="textit">condor_master</span> wouldn&#8217;t send alive messages to systemd if systemd wasn&#8217;t part of the Linux
     distribution&#8217;s standard configuration. This would result in systemd killing the HTCondor daemons
     after a short period of time. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6385" >(Ticket #6385).</a>

     <li class="itemize">Fixed handling of backslashes in string values in old ClassAds format in the Python bindings. <a

     <li class="itemize">Fixed a bug that caused a machine claimed by a parallel universe job to stick in the Claimed/Idle state
     forever. This could only happen if the job was removed as it was in the process of claiming resources.
     <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6376" >(Ticket #6376).</a>
     </li>

     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Fixed a bug that caused an infinite loop in the <span class="textit">condor_starter</span> when cgroups were enabled on systems
     (such as Debian) where the kernel has disabled the memory accounting controller. A job on such a
     system would go into the "R" state, but never actually start running. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6347" >(Ticket #6347).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Fixed a bug where setting <span class="texttt">NETWORK_INTERFACE</span> to an IPv6 address could cause HTCondor daemons to

     <li class="itemize">Fixed a bug that could cause <span class="textit">condor_submit</span> to fail to submit a job with a proxy file to a <span class="textit">condor_schedd</span>
     older than 8.5.8, due to the absence of an X.509 CA certificates directory. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6258" >(Ticket #6258).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Restored  a  check  in  <span class="textit">condor_submit</span>  about  whether  the  job&#8217;s  X.509  proxy  has  sufficient  lifetime
     remaining. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6283" >(Ticket #6283).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Fixed a bug in <span class="textit">condor_dagman</span> where the DAG status file showed an incorrect status code if submit
     attempts failed for the final node. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6069" >(Ticket #6069).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Bosco now properly identifies CentOS 7 as a supported platform. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6303" >(Ticket #6303).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Fixed a bug when Bosco is used to submit jobs to multiple remote clusters. When arguments to
     <span class="textit">remote_gahp</span> are provided in the GridResource attribute, jobs could be submitted to the wrong cluster.
     <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6277" >(Ticket #6277).</a>
                                                                                         

                                                                                         
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">To speed up the installation process on Enterprise Linux 7, the SELinux profile is now reloaded only
     once, when setting the HTCondor daemons to run in permissive mode. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6304" >(Ticket #6304).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Update  the  systemd  configuration  on  Enterprise  Linux  7  to  start  the  <span class="textit">condor_master</span> after  time
     synchronization is achieved. This prevents unnecessary daemon restarts due to sudden time shifts.
     <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6255" >(Ticket #6255).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The <span class="textit">condor_shadow</span> will now ignore updates of <span class="texttt">JobStartDate</span> from the <span class="textit">condor_starter</span> since the
     <span class="textit">condor_schedd</span> already sets this attribute correctly and the <span class="textit">condor_starter</span> incorrectly tries to set it
     even if the job has already run once. A consequence of this fix is that the value of <span class="texttt">JobStartDate</span> that
     the <span class="textit">condor_startd</span> uses for policy expressions will be different than the value that the <span class="textit">condor_schedd</span>
     uses. Resolving this problem will potentially break existing policy expressions in the <span class="textit">condor_startd</span>,
     so it will be be not be changed in the 8.6 series, but fixed in the 8.7 series. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6280" >(Ticket #6280).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Fixed a bug where per-instance job attributes like <span class="texttt">RemoteHost</span> would show up in the history file for
     completed jobs. This bug occurred if a job happened to complete while the <span class="textit">condor_schedd</span> was in the
     process of a graceful shutdown. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6251" >(Ticket #6251).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The <span class="textit">condor_convert_history</span> command is present again in this release. <a

     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The  <span class="textbf">reverse</span>  option  for  <span class="textit">condor_q</span>  was  changed  to  <span class="textbf">reverse-analyze</span>,  and  it  now  implies

     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Fixed a bug that could cause <span class="textit">condor_store_cred</span> to fail on Windows due to a case-sensitive check of

     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Docker universe detection is now more robust in the face of extraneous output to standard error on
     docker startup. This was preventing Condor from detecting that docker was properly working on hosts.
     <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6185" >(Ticket #6185).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Fixed a bug that prevented <span class="texttt">SUBMIT_REQUIREMENT</span> and <span class="texttt">JOB_TRANSFORM</span> expressions from referencing

     <li class="itemize">The Linux kernel tuning script no longer adjusts some kernel parameters unless a <span class="textit">condor_schedd</span> will

href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6208" >(Ticket #6208).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Fixed a bug that caused all but the first in a list of metaknobs to be ignored unless there were
     commas separating the list items. So <span class="texttt">use ROLE : Execute CentralManager</span> would incorrectly add
     only the Execute role. Previously, <span class="texttt">use ROLE : Execute, CentralManager</span> would correctly add both

href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6171" >(Ticket #6171).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Worked around a problem with FORTRAN programs built with <span class="textit">condor_compile</span> and recent versions
     of gfortran (4.7.2 was OK, 4.8.5 was not), where those executables would not write to standard out if
     started in the standard universe. Also, updated the checkpointing library to permit <span class="textit">condor_compile</span>
     to successfully link FORTRAN (and other) programs calling certain math functions and built against
     up-to-date versions of glibc. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6026" >(Ticket #6026).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The default values for <span class="texttt">HAD_SOCKET_NAME</span> and <span class="texttt">REPLICATION_SOCKET_NAME</span> have changed to enable the
     documented configuration for using these services with shared port to work. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6186" >(Ticket #6186).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Fixed a bug that caused <span class="textit">condor_dagman</span> to sometimes (rarely, but repeatably) crash when parsing
     DAGs containing splices. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6170" >(Ticket #6170).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The configuration parameters that control when job policy expressions are evaluated now work as
     documented. Previously, the default value for <span class="texttt">PERIODIC_EXPR_INTERVAL</span> was 300, not 60 as intended.
     Also, the parameters <span class="texttt">MAX_PERIODIC_EXPR_INTERVAL</span> and <span class="texttt">PERIODIC_EXPR_TIMESLICE</span> were ignored for

     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Fixed a bug that caused updates of the job attribute <span class="texttt">x509UserProxyExpiration</span> to be ignored for job
     policy evaluation when the job was managed by the Job Router. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6209" >(Ticket #6209).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Changed the default value of configuration parameters <span class="texttt">CREAM_GAHP_WORKER_THREADS</span> to the value of
     <span class="texttt">GRIDMANAGER_MAX_PENDING_REQUESTS</span>. This should prevent a back-log of commands in the CREAM
     GAHP observed by some users. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6071" >(Ticket #6071).</a>

href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6211" >(Ticket #6211).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Fixed a bug that caused <span class="textit">condor_submit</span> <span class="textbf">-dump</span> to crash when the submit file had an attribute to
     enable the use of an x509 user proxy. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6197" >(Ticket #6197).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Updated the supported platform list in the Bosco installer script to include Ubuntu 16 and Mac OSX
     10.12. Also, dropped Ubuntu 12 and Mac OSX 10.6 through 10.9. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6178" >(Ticket #6178).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Fixed a bug which in some obscure configurations caused a spurious PERMISSION DENIED error was
     printed in the StartLog when activating a claim. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6172" >(Ticket #6172).</a>.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Fixed a bug which forced the administrator to restart (rather than reconfigure) running daemons after

     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The CLAIMTOBE authentication method is now in the list of methods for READ access if no list of

     sites that use the default host based security model to use <span class="textit">condor_q</span> <span class="textbf">-global</span> with the only-my-jobs

     <li class="itemize">Update Docker interface to be able to retrieve usage information from running containers and to remove

href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6088" >(Ticket #6088).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">In Docker universe, all writes to files in <span class="texttt">/tmp</span> and <span class="texttt">/var/tmp</span> by default write inside the container. There
     is a limit on the file size within the container, and jobs that write a lot to <span class="texttt">/tmp</span> may hit that. If a
     docker universe job now runs on a system with <span class="texttt">MOUNT_UNDER_SCRATCH</span> defined, HTCondor now adds
     those mounts as volume mounts, so file writes do not go to the container, but to the host file system.

     <li class="itemize">Fixed a bug that caused the Job Router to not route any jobs if the <span class="texttt">JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS</span> configuration
     parameter value started with white space. <a

     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Removed Bosco&#8217;s attempt to configure a default value for <span class="textbf">grid_resource</span> in the submit description

     <li class="itemize">Fixed a bug where the <span class="textit">condor_gridmanager</span> fails to put a job on hold due to the desired hold reason
     containing invalid characters. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6142" >(Ticket #6142).</a>

<!--l. 1333--><p class="noindent" >Release Notes:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">HTCondor version 8.6.0 released on January 26, 2017.
     </li></ul>
<!--l. 1342--><p class="noindent" >New Features:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Added two new job ClassAd attributes, <span class="texttt">CumulativeRemoteSysCpu</span> and <span class="texttt">CumulativeRemoteUserCpu</span>,
     which keep a running total of system and user CPU usage, respectively, across all job restarts. Also,
     immediately clear attributes <span class="texttt">RemoteSysCpu</span> and <span class="texttt">RemoveUserCpu</span> on job start, instead of on first update.
     <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6022" >(Ticket #6022).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Added a new configuration knob, <span class="texttt">ALWAYS_REUSEADDR</span>, which defaults to <span class="texttt">True</span>. When <span class="texttt">True</span>, it tells
     HTCondor to set the <span class="texttt">SO_REUSEADDR</span> socket option, so that the schedd can run large numbers of very
     short jobs without exhausting the number of local ports needed for shadows. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6040" >(Ticket #6040).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Changed the default value of <span class="texttt">IGNORE_LEAF_OOM</span> to <span class="texttt">True</span>. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=5775" >(Ticket #5775).</a>
     </li></ul>
<!--l. 1364--><p class="noindent" >Bugs Fixed:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Fixed a bug causing unnecessarily slow updates from the <span class="textit">condor_startd</span>. If you depend on the old
     behavior, set <span class="texttt">UPDATE_SPREAD_TIME</span> to 8. A value of 0 enables the fix. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6062" >(Ticket #6062).</a>
                                                                                         

                                                                                         
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Fixed a race condition when running multiple concurrent jobs on the same claim. When the starter
     exits, it notifies the shadow, which tells the startd to kill the starter. Immediately after the shadows
     tells the startd, it fetches the next job, and tries to start it. If the starter hasn&#8217;t completely exited
     yet (perhaps it needs to clean up a large sandbox), it will notice the shadow has closed the command
     socket, and the starter will go into disconnected mode, and get confused. This has been fixed. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6049" >(Ticket
     #6049).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Fixed an infelicity with <span class="textit">condor_submit</span> -i and docker universe, where it would start an interactive shell
     without a container. Added error message expressing that this combination is not currently supported.
     <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6083" >(Ticket #6083).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">When a job claimed by the Job Router is held or removed, it is no longer considered a failure of the
     job route chosen for that job. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=5968" >(Ticket #5968).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Fixed a bug in recovering a Google Compute Engine (GCE) job if the <span class="textit">condor_gridmanager</span> restarts
     during submission of the instance request. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6078" >(Ticket #6078).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Fixed a bug that could cause re-installation of a remote cluster to fail in Bosco. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6042" >(Ticket #6042).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Fixed a bug with handling the proxy files of grid-type batch jobs when the proxy&#8217;s file name is a relative
     path. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6053" >(Ticket #6053).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Fixed a bug that caused the <span class="textit">batch_gahp</span> to crash when a job&#8217;s X.509 proxy is refreshed and the
     <span class="textit">batch_gahp</span> is configured to not create a limited copy of the proxy. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6051" >(Ticket #6051).</a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Fixed a bug in the virtual machine universe where <span class="texttt">RequestMemory</span> and <span class="texttt">RequestCPUs</span> were not changing
     the resources assigned to the VM created by HTCondor. Now, <span class="texttt">VM_Memory</span> defaults to <span class="texttt">RequestMemory</span>,
     and the number of CPUs defaults to <span class="texttt">RequestCPUs</span>. <a 
href="https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=5998" >(Ticket #5998).</a>
     </li></ul>
