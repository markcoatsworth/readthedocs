<!--l. 1857--><p class="noindent" >Job priorities allow a user to assign a priority level to each of their own submitted HTCondor jobs, in order to
control the order of job execution. This handles the situation in which a user has more jobs queued, waiting to be
executed, than there are machines available. Setting a job priority identifies the ordering in which that user&#8217;s jobs
are executed; a higher job priority job is matched and executed before a lower priority job. A job priority can be any
integer, and larger values are of higher priority. So, 0 is a higher job priority than -3, and 6 is a higher job priority
than 5.
<a 
 id="dx19-63003"></a>
<!--l. 1870--><p class="indent" >   For the simple case, each job can be given a distinct priority. For an already queued job, its priority may be set
with the <span class="textit">condor_prio</span> command; see the example in section&#x00A0;<a 
href="ManagingaJob.html#x18-570002.6.4">2.6.4<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:job-prio --></a>, or the <span class="textit">condor_prio</span> manual page&#x00A0;<a

This sets the value of job ClassAd attribute <span class="texttt">JobPrio</span>.
<!--l. 1877--><p class="indent" >   A fine-grained categorization of jobs and their ordering is available for experts by using the job ClassAd
attributes: <span class="texttt">PreJobPrio1</span>, <span class="texttt">PreJobPrio2</span>, <span class="texttt">JobPrio</span>, <span class="texttt">PostJobPrio1</span>, or <span class="texttt">PostJobPrio2</span>.

<!--l. 1892--><p class="noindent" >Machines are allocated to users based upon a user&#8217;s priority. A lower numerical value for user priority means higher
priority, so a user with priority 5 will get more resources than a user with priority 50. User priorities in HTCondor
can be examined with the <span class="textit">condor_userprio</span> command (see page&#x00A0;<a 
href="Condoruserprio.html#x160-116800012">2298<!--tex4ht:ref: man-condor-userprio --></a>). <a 
 id="dx19-64004"></a>HTCondor administrators can set and
change individual user priorities with the same utility.
<!--l. 1902--><p class="indent" >   HTCondor continuously calculates the share of available machines that each user should be allocated. This share
is inversely related to the ratio between user priorities. For example, a user with a priority of 10 will get twice as
many machines as a user with a priority of 20. The priority of each individual user changes according to the number
of resources the individual is using. Each user starts out with the best possible priority: 0.5. If the number of
machines a user currently has is greater than the user priority, the user priority will worsen by numerically
increasing over time. If the number of machines is less then the priority, the priority will improve by numerically
decreasing over time. The long-term result is fair-share access across all users. The speed at which HTCondor
adjusts the priorities is controlled with the configuration variable <span class="texttt">PRIORITY_HALFLIFE</span> <a 
 id="dx19-64005"></a><a 
 id="dx19-64006"></a>, an exponential half-life
value. The default is one day. If a user that has user priority of 100 and is utilizing 100 machines removes
all his/her jobs, one day later that user&#8217;s priority will be 50, and two days later the priority will be
25.
<!--l. 1925--><p class="indent" >   HTCondor enforces that each user gets his/her fair share of machines according to user priority both when
allocating machines which become available and by priority preemption of currently allocated machines. For
instance, if a low priority user is utilizing all available machines and suddenly a higher priority user submits jobs,
HTCondor will immediately take a checkpoint and vacate jobs belonging to the lower priority user. This will free up
machines that HTCondor will then give over to the higher priority user. HTCondor will not starve the lower priority
user; it will preempt only enough jobs so that the higher priority user&#8217;s fair share can be realized
(based upon the ratio between user priorities). To prevent thrashing of the system due to priority
preemption, the HTCondor site administrator can define a <span class="texttt">PREEMPTION_REQUIREMENTS</span> <a 
 id="dx19-64007"></a><a 
 id="dx19-64008"></a> expression in
HTCondor&#8217;s configuration. The default expression that ships with HTCondor is configured to only
preempt lower priority jobs that have run for at least one hour. So in the previous example, in the worse
case it could take up to a maximum of one hour until the higher priority user receives a fair share of
machines. For a general discussion of limiting preemption, please see section <a 
href="PolicyConfigurationforExecuteHostsandforSubmitHosts.html#x35-2520003.7.1">3.7.1<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:DisablingPreemption --></a> of the Administrator&#8217;s
manual.
<!--l. 1947--><p class="indent" >   User priorities are keyed on <span class="texttt">&#x003C;username&#x003E;@&#x003C;domain&#x003E;</span>, for example <span class="texttt">johndoe@cs.wisc.edu</span>. The domain name to
use, if any, is configured by the HTCondor site administrator. Thus, user priority and therefore resource allocation is
not impacted by which machine the user submits from or even if the user submits jobs from multiple
machines.
<a 
 id="dx19-64009"></a>
<a 
 id="dx19-64010"></a>
<!--l. 1955--><p class="indent" >   An extra feature is the ability to submit a job as a <span class="emph">nice</span> job (see page&#x00A0;<a 
href="Condorsubmit.html#x149-108400012">2205<!--tex4ht:ref: man-condor-submit-nice-user --></a>). Nice jobs artificially boost
the user priority by ten million just for the nice job. This effectively means that nice jobs will only
run on machines that no other HTCondor job (that is, non-niced job) wants. In a similar fashion, an
HTCondor administrator could set the user priority of any specific HTCondor user very high. If done,
                                                                                         

                                                                                         
for example, with a guest account, the guest could only use cycles not wanted by other users of the
system.

<a

<a

<!--l. 1974--><p class="noindent" >When HTCondor needs a job to vacate a machine for whatever reason, it sends the job an asynchronous signal
specified in the <span class="texttt">KillSig</span> attribute of the job&#8217;s ClassAd. The value of this attribute can be specified by the user at
submit time by placing the <span class="textbf">kill_sig</span> option in the HTCondor submit description file.
<!--l. 1981--><p class="indent" >   If a program wanted to do some special work when required to vacate a machine, the program may set up a
signal handler to use a trappable signal as an indication to clean up. When submitting this job, this clean up signal
is specified to be used with <span class="textbf">kill_sig</span>. Note that the clean up work needs to be quick. If the job takes
too long to go away, HTCondor follows up with a SIGKILL signal which immediately terminates the
process.
<a 
 id="dx19-65003"></a>
<!--l. 1993--><p class="indent" >   A job that is linked using <span class="textit">condor_compile</span> and is subsequently submitted into the standard universe, will
checkpoint and exit upon receipt of a SIGTSTP signal. Thus, SIGTSTP is the default value for <span class="texttt">KillSig</span> when
submitting to the standard universe. The user&#8217;s code may still checkpoint itself at any time by calling one of the
following functions exported by the HTCondor libraries:
     <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
ckpt()() </dt><dd 
class="description">Performs a checkpoint and then returns.
     </dd><dt class="description">
ckpt_and_exit()() </dt><dd 
class="description">Checkpoints and exits; HTCondor will then restart the process again later, potentially
     on a different machine.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 2007--><p class="indent" >   For jobs submitted into the vanilla universe, the default value for <span class="texttt">KillSig</span> is SIGTERM, the usual method to
nicely terminate a Unix program.
