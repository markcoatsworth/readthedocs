================

HTCondor supports placing machines in low power states. A machine in the
low power state is identified as being offline. Power setting decisions
are based upon HTCondor configuration.

Power conservation is relevant when machines are not in heavy use, or
when there are known periods of low activity within the pool.

Entering a Low Power State
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, HTCondor does not do power management. When desired, the
ability to place a machine into a low power state is accomplished
through configuration. This occurs when all slots on a machine agree
that a low power state is desired.

A slot’s readiness to hibernate is determined by the evaluating the
HIBERNATE configuration variable (see
section \ `3.5.8 <ConfigurationMacros.html#x33-1950003.5.8>`__ on
page \ `679 <ConfigurationMacros.html#x33-1950003.5.8>`__) within the
context of the slot. Readiness is evaluated at fixed intervals, as
determined by the HIBERNATE\_CHECK\_INTERVAL configuration variable. A
non-zero value of this variable enables the power management facility.
It is an integer value representing seconds, and it need not be a small
value. There is a trade off between the extra time not at a low power
state and the unnecessary computation of readiness.

To put the machine in a low power state rapidly after it has become
idle, consider checking each slot’s state frequently, as in the example
configuration:

::

    HIBERNATE_CHECK_INTERVAL = 20

This checks each slot’s readiness every 20 seconds. A more common value
for frequency of checks is 300 (5 minutes). A value of 300 loses some
degree of granularity, but it is more reasonable as machines are likely
to be put in to a low power state after a few hours, rather than
minutes.

A slot’s readiness or willingness to enter a low power state is
determined by the HIBERNATE expression. Because this expression is
evaluated in the context of each slot, and not on the machine as a
whole, any one slot can veto a change of power state. The HIBERNATE
expression may reference a wide array of variables. Possibilities
include the change in power state if none of the slots are claimed, or
if the slots are not in the Owner state.

Here is a concrete example. Assume that the START expression is not set
to always be True. This permits an easy determination whether or not the
machine is in an Unclaimed state through the use of an auxiliary macro
called ShouldHibernate.

::

    TimeToWait  = (2 * $(HOUR))
     ShouldHibernate = ( (KeyboardIdle > $(StartIdleTime)) \
                         && $(CPUIdle) \
                         && ($(StateTimer) > $(TimeToWait)) )

This macro evaluates to True if the following are all True:

-  The keyboard has been idle long enough.
-  The CPU is idle.
-  The slot has been Unclaimed for more than 2 hours.

The sample HIBERNATE expression that enters the power state called
"RAM", if ShouldHibernate evaluates to True, and remains in its current
state otherwise is

::

    HibernateState  = "RAM"
     HIBERNATE = ifThenElse($(ShouldHibernate), $(HibernateState), "NONE" )

If any slot returns "NONE", that slot vetoes the decision to enter a low
power state. Only when values returned by all slots are all non-zero is
there a decision to enter a low power state. If all agree to enter the
low power state, but differ in which state to enter, then the largest
magnitude value is chosen.

Returning From a Low Power State
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The HTCondor command line tool *condor\_power* may wake a machine from a
low power state by sending a UDP Wake On LAN (WOL) packet. See the
*condor\_power* manual page on
page \ `1968 <Condorpower.html#x126-89100012>`__.

To automatically call *condor\_power* under specific conditions,
*condor\_rooster* may be used. The configuration options for
*condor\_rooster* are described in
section \ `3.5.29 <ConfigurationMacros.html#x33-2250003.5.29>`__.

Keeping a ClassAd for a Hibernating Machine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A pool’s *condor\_collector* daemon can be configured to keep a
persistent ClassAd entry for each machine, once it has entered
hibernation. This is required by *condor\_rooster* so that it can
evaluate the UNHIBERNATE expression of the offline machines.

To do this, define a log file using the OFFLINE\_LOG configuration
variable. See
section \ `3.5.8 <ConfigurationMacros.html#x33-1950003.5.8>`__ on
page \ `681 <ConfigurationMacros.html#x33-1950003.5.8>`__ for the
definition. An optional expiration time for each ClassAd can be
specified with OFFLINE\_EXPIRE\_ADS\_AFTER . The timing begins from the
time the hibernating machine’s ClassAd enters the *condor\_collector*
daemon. See
section \ `3.5.8 <ConfigurationMacros.html#x33-1950003.5.8>`__ on
page \ `681 <ConfigurationMacros.html#x33-1950003.5.8>`__ for the
definition.

Linux Platform Details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Depending on the Linux distribution and version, there are three methods
for controlling a machine’s power state. The methods:

#. *pm-utils* is a set of command line tools which can be used to detect
   and switch power states. In HTCondor, this is defined by the string
   "pm-utils".
#. The directory in the virtual file system /sys/power contains virtual
   files that can be used to detect and set the power states. In
   HTCondor, this is defined by the string "/sys".
#. The directory in the virtual file system /proc/acpi contains virtual
   files that can be used to detect and set the power states. In
   HTCondor, this is defined by the string "/proc".

By default, the HTCondor attempts to detect the method to use in the
order shown. The first method detected as usable on the system is
chosen.

This ordered detection may be bypassed, to use a specified method
instead by setting the configuration variable LINUX\_HIBERNATION\_METHOD
with one of the defined strings. This variable is defined in
section \ `3.5.8 <ConfigurationMacros.html#x33-1950003.5.8>`__ on
page \ `681 <ConfigurationMacros.html#x33-1950003.5.8>`__. If no usable
methods are detected or the method specified by
LINUX\_HIBERNATION\_METHOD is either not detected or invalid,
hibernation is disabled.

The details of this selection process, and the final method selected can
be logged via enabling D\_FULLDEBUG in the relevant subsystem’s log
configuration.

Windows Platform Details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If after a suitable amount of time, a Windows machine has not entered
the expected power state, then HTCondor is having difficulty exercising
the operating system’s low power capabilities. While the cause will be
specific to the machine’s hardware, it may also be due to improperly
configured software. For hardware difficulties, the likely culprit is
the configuration within the machine’s BIOS, for which HTCondor can
offer little guidance. For operating system difficulties, the *powercfg*
tool can be used to discover the available power states on the machine.
The following command demonstrates how to list all of the supported
power states of the machine:

::

    > powercfg -A
     The following sleep states are available on this system:
     Standby (S3) Hibernate Hybrid Sleep
     The following sleep states are not available on this system:
     Standby (S1)
             The system firmware does not support this standby state.
     Standby (S2)
             The system firmware does not support this standby state.

Note that the HIBERNATE expression is written in terms of the Sn state,
where n is the value evaluated from the expression.

This tool can also be used to enable and disable other sleep states.
This example turns hibernation on.

::

    > powercfg -h on

If this tool is insufficient for configuring the machine in the manner
required, the *Power Options* control panel application offers the full
extent of the machine’s power management abilities. Windows 2000 and XP
lack the *powercfg* program, so all configuration must be done via the
*Power Options* control panel application.
