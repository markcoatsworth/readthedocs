=================================

Report the statistics of a DAGMan run to a central HTTP server

Synopsis
^^^^^^^^

**condor\_dagman\_metrics\_reporter** [**-s**\ ] [**-u  **\ *URL*]
[**-t  **\ *maxtime*] **-f **\ */path/to/metrics/file*

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

*condor\_dagman\_metrics\_reporter* anonymously reports metrics from a
DAGMan workflow to a central server. The reporting of workflow metrics
is only enabled for DAGMan workflows run under Pegasus; metrics
reporting has been requested by Pegasus’ funding sources: see
`http://pegasus.isi.edu/wms/docs/latest/funding\_citing\_usage.php#usage\_statistics <http://pegasus.isi.edu/wms/docs/latest/funding_citing_usage.php#usage_statistics>`__
and
`https://confluence.pegasus.isi.edu/display/pegasus/DAGMan+Metrics+Reporting <https://confluence.pegasus.isi.edu/display/pegasus/DAGMan+Metrics+Reporting>`__
for the requirements to collect this data.

The data sent to the server is in JSON format. Here is an example of
what is sent:

::

    {
         "client":"condor_dagman",
         "version":"8.1.0",
         "planner":"/lfs1/devel/Pegasus/pegasus/bin/pegasus-plan",
         "planner_version":"4.3.0cvs",
         "type":"metrics",
         "wf_uuid":"htcondor-test-job_dagman_metrics-A-subdag",
         "root_wf_uuid":"htcondor-test-job_dagman_metrics-A",
         "start_time":1375313459.603,
         "end_time":1375313491.498,
         "duration":31.895,
         "exitcode":1,
         "dagman_id":"26",
         "parent_dagman_id":"11",
         "rescue_dag_number":0,
         "jobs":4,
         "jobs_failed":1,
         "jobs_succeeded":3,
         "dag_jobs":0,
         "dag_jobs_failed":0,
         "dag_jobs_succeeded":0,
         "total_jobs":4,
         "total_jobs_run":4,
         "total_job_time":0.000,
         "dag_status":2
     }

Metrics are sent only if the *condor\_dagman* process has
PEGASUS\_METRICS set to True in its environment, and the
CONDOR\_DEVELOPERS configuration variable does not have the value NONE.

Ordinarily, this program will be run by *condor\_dagman*, and users do
not need to interact with it. This program uses the following
environment variables:

 PEGASUS\_USER\_METRICS\_DEFAULT\_SERVER
    The URL of the default server to which to send the data. It defaults
    to http://metrics.pegasus.isi.edu/metrics. It can be overridden at
    the command line with the **-u** option.
 PEGASUS\_USER\_METRICS\_SERVER
    A comma separated list of URLs of servers that will receive the
    data, in addition to the default server.

The *-f* argument specifies the metrics file to be sent to the HTTP
server.

Options
^^^^^^^

 **-s**
    Sleep for a random number of seconds between 1 and 10, before
    attempting to send data. This option is used to space out the
    reporting from any sub-DAGs when a DAG is removed.
 **-u **\ *URL*
    Overrides setting of the environment variable
    PEGASUS\_USER\_METRICS\_DEFAULT\_SERVER. This option is unused by
    *condor\_dagman*; it is for testing by developers.
 **-t **\ *maxtime*
    A maximum time in seconds that defaults to 100 seconds, setting a
    limit on the amount of time this program will wait for communication
    from the server. A setting of zero will result in a single attempt
    per server. *condor\_dagman* retrieves this value from the
    DAGMAN\_PEGASUS\_REPORT\_TIMEOUT configuration variable.
 **-f **\ *metrics\_file*
    The name of the file containing the metrics values to be reported.

Exit Status
^^^^^^^^^^^

*condor\_dagman\_metrics\_reporter* will exit with a status value of 0
(zero) upon success, and it will exit with a value of 1 (one) upon
failure.
