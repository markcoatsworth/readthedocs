===============

suspend jobs from the HTCondor queue

Synopsis
^^^^^^^^

**condor\_suspend** [**-help \| -version**\ ]

**condor\_suspend** [**-debug**\ ] [
**-pool **\ *centralmanagerhostname[:portnumber]* \|
**-name **\ *scheddname* ] \| [**-addr  **\ *"<a.b.c.d:port>"*] **

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

*condor\_suspend* suspends one or more jobs from the HTCondor job queue.
When a job is suspended, the match between the *condor\_schedd* and
machine is not been broken, such that the claim is still valid. But, the
job is not making any progress and HTCondor is no longer generating a
load on the machine. If the **-name** option is specified, the named
*condor\_schedd* is targeted for processing. Otherwise, the local
*condor\_schedd* is targeted. The job(s) to be suspended are identified
by one of the job identifiers, as described below. For any given job,
only the owner of the job or one of the queue super users (defined by
the QUEUE\_SUPER\_USERS macro) can suspend the job.

Exit Status
