Platform-Specific Information
-----------------------------

The HTCondor Team strives to make HTCondor work the same way across all
supported platforms. However, because HTCondor is a very low-level
system which interacts closely with the internals of the operating
systems on which it runs, this goal is not always possible to achieve.
The following sections provide detailed information about using HTCondor
on different computing platforms and operating systems.
