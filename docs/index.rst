Welcome to the HTCondor Manual
==============================

This is a demo to see how well the HTCondor manual integrates into Read The Docs. These pages show examples of text formatting, images, cross-linking, indexing, custom extensions (ie. macros, linking to HTCondor tickets) and integration with GitHub. I've also set up an offline Sphinx environment so I can develop these docs locally before committing my changes to git.
