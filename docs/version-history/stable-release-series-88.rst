Version 8.8.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Release Notes:

-  HTCondor version 8.8.0 released on January 3, 2019.

New Features:

-  Provides a new package: minicondor on Red Hat based systems and
   minihtcondor on Debian and Ubuntu based systems. This mini-HTCondor
   package configures HTCondor to work on a single machine. `(Ticket
   #6823). <https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6823>`__
-  Made the Python bindings’ JobEvent API more Pythonic by handling
   optional event attributes as if the JobEvent object were a
   dictionary, instead. See section
   `7.1.1 <PythonBindings.html#x69-5500007.1.1>`__ for details. `(Ticket
   #6820). <https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6820>`__
-  Added job ad attribute BlockReadKbytes and BlockWriteKybtes which
   describe the number of kbytes read and written by the job to the
   sandbox directory. These are only defined on Linux machines with
   cgroup support enabled for vanilla jobs. `(Ticket
   #6826). <https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6826>`__
-  The new IOWait attribute gives the I/O Wait time recorded by the
   cgroup controller. `(Ticket
   #6830). <https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6830>`__
-  *condor\_ssh\_to\_job* is now configured to be more secure. In
   particular, it will only use FIPS 140-2 approved algorithms. `(Ticket
   #6822). <https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6822>`__
-  Added configuration parameter CRED\_SUPER\_USERS, a list of users who
   are permitted to store credentials for any user when using the
   *condor\_store\_credd* command. Normally, users can only store
   credentials for themselves. `(Ticket
   #6346). <https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6346>`__
-  For packaged HTCondor installations, the package version is now
   present in the HTCondor version string. `(Ticket
   #6828). <https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6828>`__

Bugs Fixed:

-  Fixed a problem where a daemon would queue updates indefinitely when
   another daemon is offline. This is most noticeable as excess memory
   utilization when a *condor\_schedd* is trying to flock to an offline
   HTCondor pool. `(Ticket
   #6837). <https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6837>`__
-  Fixed a bug where invoking the Python bindings as root could change
   the effective uid of the calling process. `(Ticket
   #6817). <https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6817>`__
-  Jobs in REMOVED status now properly leave the queue when evaluation
   of their LeaveJobInQueue attribute changes from True to False.
   `(Ticket
   #6808). <https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6808>`__
-  Fixed a rarely occurring bug where the *condor\_schedd* would crash
   when jobs were submitted with a queue statement with multiple keys.
   The bug was introduced in the 8.7.10 release. `(Ticket
   #6827). <https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6827>`__
-  Fixed a couple of bugs in the job event log reader code that were
   made visible by the new JobEventLog python object. The remote error
   and job terminated event did not read all of the available
   information from the job log correctly. `(Ticket
   #6816). <https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6816>`__
   `(Ticket
   #6836). <https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6836>`__
-  On Debian and Ubuntu systems, the templates for
   *condor\_ssh\_to\_job* and interactive submits are no longer
   installed in /etc/condor. `(Ticket
   #6770). <https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6770>`__
