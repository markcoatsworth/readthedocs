Release Notes:

-  HTCondor version 8.9.0 not yet released.

New Features:

-  Normally, HTCondor requires the user to specify their credentials
   when using EC2 (via the grid universe or via *condor\_annex*). This
   allows users to use different accounts from the same machine.
   However, if a user started an EC2 instance with the privileges
   necessary to start other instances, and ran HTCondor in that
   instance, HTCondor was unable to use that instance’s privileges; the
   user still had to specify their credentials. Instead, the user may
   now specify “FROM INSTANCE” instead of the name of a credential file
   to indicate that HTCondor should use the instance’s credentials.

   By default, any user with access to a privileged EC2 instance has
   access to that instance’s privileges. If you would like to make use
   of this feature, please read
   `6.4.1 <HTCondorAnnexCustomizationGuide.html#x66-5390006.4.1>`__
   before adding privileges (an instance role) to an instance which
   allows access by other users, specifically including the submitting
   of jobs to or running jobs on that instance. `(Ticket
   #6789). <https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6789>`__

-  the *condor\_hdfs* daemon which allowed the hdfs daemons to run under
   the *condor\_master* has been removed from the contributed source.
   `(Ticket
   #6809). <https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6809>`__
-  Scheduler Universe jobs now start in order of priority, instead of
   random order. This is most typically used for DAGMan. When running
   *condor\_submit\_dag* against a .dag file, you can use the -priority
   <N> flag to set the priority for the overall *condor\_dagman* job.
   When the *condor\_schedd* is starting new Scheduler Universe jobs,
   the highest priority queued job will start first. If all queued
   Scheduler Universe jobs have equal priority, they get started in
   order of subnmission. `(Ticket
   #6703). <https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6703>`__

Bugs Fixed:

-  None.
