=================================

The quality of the HTCondor project is enhanced by the contributions of
external organizations. We gratefully acknowledge the following
contributions.

-  The Globus Alliance
   (`http://www.globus.org <http://www.globus.org>`__), for code and
   assistance in developing HTCondor-G and the Grid Security
   Infrastructure (GSI) for authentication and authorization.
-  The GOZAL Project from the Computer Science Department of the
   Technion Israel Institute of Technology
   (`http://www.technion.ac.il/ <http://www.technion.ac.il/>`__), for
   their enhancements for HTCondor’s High Availability. The
   *condor\_had* daemon allows one of multiple machines to function as
   the central manager for a HTCondor pool. Therefore, if an acting
   central manager fails, another can take its place.
-  Micron Corporation
   (`http://www.micron.com/ <http://www.micron.com/>`__) for the
   MSI-based installer for HTCondor on Windows.
-  Paradyn Project
   (`http://www.paradyn.org/ <http://www.paradyn.org/>`__) and the
   Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona
   (`http://www.caos.uab.es/ <http://www.caos.uab.es/>`__) for work on
   the Tool Daemon Protocol (TDP).
