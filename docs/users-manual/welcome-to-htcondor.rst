===================

HTCondor is developed by the Center for High Throughput Computing at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison), and was first installed as
a production system in the UW-Madison Computer Sciences department more
than 15 years ago. HTCondor pools have since served as a major source of
computing cycles to UW faculty and students. For many, it has
revolutionized the role computing plays in their research. An increase
of one, and sometimes even two, orders of magnitude in the computing
throughput of a research organization can have a profound impact on
research size, complexity, and scope. Over the years, the project, and
now the Center for High Throughput Computing have established
collaborations with scientists from around the world, and have provided
them with access to many cycles. One scientist consumed 100 CPU years!
