==========================

 AcceptedWhileDraining:
    Boolean which indicates if the slot accepted its current job while
    the machine was draining.
 Activity:
    String which describes HTCondor job activity on the machine. Can
    have one of the following values:

     "Idle":
        There is no job activity

     "Retiring":
        Waiting for a job to finish or for the maximum retirement time
        to expire

 Arch:
    String with the architecture of the machine. Currently supported
    architectures have the following string definitions:

     "INTEL":
        Intel x86 CPU (Pentium, Xeon, etc).
     "X86\_64":
        AMD/Intel 64-bit X86

    These strings show definitions for architectures no longer

     "PPC":
        32-bit PowerPC
     "PPC64":
        64-bit PowerPC

 CanHibernate:
    The *condor\_startd* has the capability to shut down or hibernate a
    machine when certain configurable criteria are met. However, before
    the *condor\_startd* can shut down a machine, the hardware itself
    must support hibernation, as must the operating system. When the
    *condor\_startd* initializes, it checks for this support. If the
    machine has the ability to hibernate, then this boolean ClassAd
    attribute will be True. By default, it is False.
 CheckpointPlatform:
    A string which opaquely encodes various aspects about a machine’s
    operating system, hardware, and kernel attributes. It is used to
    identify systems where previously taken checkpoints for the standard
    universe may resume.
 ClockDay:
    The day of the week, where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, …, and 6 =
    Saturday.
 ClockMin:
    The number of minutes passed since midnight.
 CondorLoadAvg:
    The load average contributed by HTCondor, either from remote jobs or
    running benchmarks.
 CondorVersion:
    A string containing the HTCondor version number for the
    *condor\_startd* daemon, the release date, and the build
    identification number.
 ConsoleIdle:
    The number of seconds since activity on the system console keyboard
    or console mouse has last been detected. The value can be modified
    with SLOTS\_CONNECTED\_TO\_CONSOLE as defined at
     `3.5.8 <ConfigurationMacros.html#x33-1950003.5.8>`__.
 Cpus:
    The number of CPUs (cores) in this slot. It is 1 for a single CPU
    slot, 2 for a dual CPU slot, etc. For a partitionable slot, it is
    the remaining number of CPUs in the partitionable slot.
 CpuFamily:
    On Linux machines, the Cpu family, as defined in the /proc/cpuinfo
    file.
 CpuModel:
    On Linux machines, the Cpu model number, as defined in the
    /proc/cpuinfo file.
 CpuCacheSize:
    On Linux machines, the size of the L3 cache, in kbytes, as defined
    in the /proc/cpuinfo file.
 CurrentRank:
    A float which represents this machine owner’s affinity for running
    the HTCondor job which it is currently hosting. If not currently
    hosting an HTCondor job, CurrentRank is 0.0. When a machine is
    claimed, the attribute’s value is computed by evaluating the
    machine’s Rank expression with respect to the current job’s ClassAd.
 DetectedCpus:
    Set by the value of configuration variable DETECTED\_CORES .
 DetectedMemory:
    Set by the value of configuration variable DETECTED\_MEMORY .
    Specified in MiB.
 Disk:
    The amount of disk space on this machine available for the job in
    KiB (for example, 23000 = 23 MiB). Specifically, this is the amount
    of disk space available in the directory specified in the HTCondor
    configuration files by the EXECUTE macro, minus any space reserved
    with the RESERVED\_DISK macro. For static slots, this value will be
    the same as machine ClassAd attribute TotalSlotDisk. For
    partitionable slots, this value will be the quantity of disk space
    remaining in the partitionable slot.
 Draining:
    This attribute is True when the slot is draining and undefined if
    not.
 DrainingRequestId:
    This attribute contains a string that is the request id of the
    draining request that put this slot in a draining state. It is
    undefined if the slot is not draining.
 DotNetVersions:
    The .NET framework versions currently installed on this computer.
    Default format is a comma delimited list. Current definitions:

     "1.1":
        for .Net Framework 1.1
     "2.0":
        for .Net Framework 2.0

     "3.5":
        for .Net Framework 3.5
     "4.0Client":
        for .Net Framework 4.0 Client install
     "4.0Full":
        for .Net Framework 4.0 Full install

 DynamicSlot:
    For SMP machines that allow dynamic partitioning of a slot, this
    boolean value identifies that this dynamic slot may be partitioned.
 EnteredCurrentActivity:
    Time at which the machine entered the current Activity (see Activity
    entry above). On all platforms (including NT), this is measured in
    the number of integer seconds since the Unix epoch (00:00:00 UTC,
    Jan 1, 1970).
 ExpectedMachineGracefulDrainingBadput:
    The job run time in cpu-seconds that would be lost if graceful
    draining were initiated at the time this ClassAd was published. This
    calculation assumes that jobs will run for the full retirement time
    and then be evicted without saving a checkpoint.
 ExpectedMachineGracefulDrainingCompletion:
    The estimated time at which graceful draining of the machine could
    complete if it were initiated at the time this ClassAd was published
    and there are no active claims. This is measured in the number of
    integer seconds since the Unix epoch (00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1, 1970).
    This value is computed with the assumption that the machine policy
    will not suspend jobs during draining while the machine is waiting
    for the job to use up its retirement time. If suspension happens,
    the upper bound on how long draining could take is unlimited. To
    avoid suspension during draining, the SUSPEND and CONTINUE
    expressions could be configured to pay attention to the Draining
    attribute.
 ExpectedMachineGracefulQuickBadput:
    The job run time in cpu-seconds that would be lost if quick or fast
    draining were initiated at the time this ClassAd was published. This
    calculation assumes that all evicted jobs will not save a
    checkpoint.
 ExpectedMachineQuickDrainingCompletion:
    Time at which quick or fast draining of the machine could complete
    if it were initiated at the time this ClassAd was published and
    there are no active claims. This is measured in the number of
    integer seconds since the Unix epoch (00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1, 1970).
 FileSystemDomain:
    A domain name configured by the HTCondor administrator which
    describes a cluster of machines which all access the same,
    uniformly-mounted, networked file systems usually via NFS or AFS.
    This is useful for Vanilla universe jobs which require remote file
    access.
 HasDocker:
    A boolean value set to True if the machine is capable of executing
    docker universe jobs.
 HasEncryptExecuteDirectory:
    A boolean value set to True if the machine is capable of encrypting
    execute directories.
 HasFileTransfer:
    A boolean value that when True identifies that the machine can use
    the file transfer mechanism.
 HasFileTransferPluginMethods:
    A string of comma-separated file transfer protocols that the machine
    can support. The value can be modified with FILETRANSFER\_PLUGINS as
    defined at  `3.5.11 <ConfigurationMacros.html#x33-1980003.5.11>`__.
 Has\_sse4\_1:
    A boolean value set to True if the machine being advertised supports
    the SSE 4.1 instructions, and Undefined otherwise.
 Has\_sse4\_2:
    A boolean value set to True if the machine being advertised supports
    the SSE 4.2 instructions, and Undefined otherwise.
 has\_ssse3:
    A boolean value set to True if the machine being advertised supports
    the SSSE 3 instructions, and Undefined otherwise.
 has\_avx:
    A boolean value set to True if the machine being advertised supports
    the avx instructions, and Undefined otherwise.
 HasSingularity:
    A boolean value set to True if the machine being advertised supports
    running jobs within Singularity containers.
 HasVM:
    If the configuration triggers the detection of virtual machine
    software, a boolean value reporting the success thereof; otherwise
    undefined. May also become False if HTCondor determines that it
    can’t start a VM (even if the appropriate software is detected).
 IsWakeAble:
    A boolean value that when True identifies that the machine has the
    capability to be woken into a fully powered and running state by
    receiving a Wake On LAN (WOL) packet. This ability is a function of
    the operating system, the network adapter in the machine (notably,
    wireless network adapters usually do not have this function), and
    BIOS settings. When the *condor\_startd* initializes, it tries to
    detect if the operating system and network adapter both support
    waking from hibernation by receipt of a WOL packet. The default
    value is False.
 IsWakeEnabled:
    If the hardware and software have the capacity to be woken into a
    fully powered and running state by receiving a Wake On LAN (WOL)
    packet, this feature can still be disabled via the BIOS or software.
    If BIOS or the operating system have disabled this feature, the
    *condor\_startd* sets this boolean attribute to False.
 JobBusyTimeAvg:
    The Average lifetime of all jobs, including transfer time. This is
    determined by measuring the lifetime of each *condor\_starter* that
    has exited. This attribute will be undefined until the first time a
    *condor\_starter* has exited.

    determined by measuring the lifetime of each *condor\_starter*\ s
    that has exited. This attribute will be undefined until the first
    time a *condor\_starter* has exited.
 JobBusyTimeMin:
    The Minimum lifetime of all jobs, including transfer time. This is
    determined by measuring the lifetime of each *condor\_starter* that
    has exited. This attribute will be undefined until the first time a
    *condor\_starter* has exited.
 RecentJobBusyTimeAvg:
    The Average lifetime of all jobs that have exited in the last 20
    minutes, including transfer time. This is determined by measuring
    the lifetime of each *condor\_starter* that has exited in the last
    20 minutes. This attribute will be undefined if no *condor\_starter*
    has exited in the last 20 minutes.

    attribute. This is also the the total number times a
    *condor\_starter* has exited in the last 20 minutes.
 RecentJobBusyTimeMax:
    The Maximum lifetime of all jobs that have exited in the last 20
    minutes, including transfer time. This is determined by measuring
    the lifetime of each *condor\_starter*\ s that has exited in the
    last 20 minutes. This attribute will be undefined if no
    *condor\_starter* has exited in the last 20 minutes.
 RecentJobBusyTimeMin:
    The Minimum lifetime of all jobs, including transfer time. This is
    determined by measuring the lifetime of each *condor\_starter* that
    has exited. This attribute will be undefined if no *condor\_starter*
    has exited in the last 20 minutes.
 JobDurationAvg:
    The Average lifetime time of all jobs, not including time spent
    transferring files. This attribute will be undefined until the first
    time a job exits. Jobs that never start (because they fail to
    transfer input, for instance) will not be included in the average.
 JobDurationCount:
    The total number of of jobs used to calulate the JobDurationAvg
    attribute. This is also the the total number times a job has exited.
    Jobs that never start (because input transfer fails, for instance)
    are not included in the count.
 JobDurationMax:
    The lifetime of the longest lived job that has exited. This
    attribute will be undefined until the first time a job exits.
 JobDurationMin:
    The lifetime of the shortest lived job that has exited. This
    attribute will be undefined until the first time a job exits.
 RecentJobDurationAvg:
    The Average lifetime time of all jobs, not including time spent
    transferring files, that have exited in the last 20 minutes. This
    attribute will be undefined if no job has exited in the last 20
    minutes.

    minutes. This attribute will be undefined if no job has exited in
    the last 20 minutes.
 RecentJobDurationMin:
    The lifetime of the shortest lived job that has exited in the last
    20 minutes. This attribute will be undefined if no job has exited in
    the last 20 minutes.
 JobPreemptions:

    machine due to the machine’s rank of jobs since the *condor\_startd*
    started running.
 JobStarts:
    The total number of jobs which have been started on this machine
    since the *condor\_startd* started running.

    machine based on a fair share allocation of the pool since the
    *condor\_startd* started running.
 JobVM\_VCPUS:
    An attribute defined if a vm universe job is running on this slot.
    Defined by the number of virtualized CPUs in the virtual machine.
 KeyboardIdle:
    The number of seconds since activity on any keyboard or mouse
    associated with this machine has last been detected. Unlike
    ConsoleIdle, KeyboardIdle also takes activity on pseudo-terminals
    into account. Pseudo-terminals have virtual keyboard activity from
    telnet and rlogin sessions. Note that KeyboardIdle will always be
    equal to or less than ConsoleIdle. The value can be modified with
    SLOTS\_CONNECTED\_TO\_KEYBOARD as defined at
     `3.5.8 <ConfigurationMacros.html#x33-1950003.5.8>`__.
 KFlops:
    Relative floating point performance as determined via a Linpack
    benchmark.

    due to *condor\_defrag* or *condor\_drain*).
 LastHeardFrom:
    Time when the HTCondor central manager last received a status update
    from this machine. Expressed as the number of integer seconds since
    the Unix epoch (00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1, 1970). Note: This attribute is
    only inserted by the central manager once it receives the ClassAd.
    It is not present in the *condor\_startd* copy of the ClassAd.
    Therefore, you could not use this attribute in defining
    *condor\_startd* expressions (and you would not want to).
 LoadAvg:
    A floating point number representing the current load average.
 Machine:
    A string with the machine’s fully qualified host name.
 MachineMaxVacateTime:
    An integer expression that specifies the time in seconds the machine
    will allow the job to gracefully shut down.
 MaxJobRetirementTime:
    When the *condor\_startd* wants to kick the job off, a job which has
    run for less than this number of seconds will not be hard-killed.
    The *condor\_startd* will wait for the job to finish or to exceed
    this amount of time, whichever comes sooner. If the job vacating
    policy grants the job X seconds of vacating time, a preempted job
    will be soft-killed X seconds before the end of its retirement time,
    so that hard-killing of the job will not happen until the end of the
    retirement time if the job does not finish shutting down before
    then. This is an expression evaluated in the context of the job
    ClassAd, so it may refer to job attributes as well as machine
    attributes.
 Memory:
    The amount of RAM in MiB in this slot. For static slots, this value
    will be the same as in TotalSlotMemory. For a partitionable slot,
    this value will be the quantity remaining in the partitionable slot.

    The current number of sockets registered by this daemon.
 MonitorSelfResidentSetSize:
    The amount of resident memory used by this daemon in KiB.
 MonitorSelfSecuritySessions:
    The number of open (cached) security sessions for this daemon.
 MonitorSelfTime:
    The time, represented as the number of second elapsed since the Unix
    epoch (00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1, 1970), at which this daemon last checked
    and set the attributes with names that begin with the string
    MonitorSelf.
 MyAddress:
    String with the IP and port address of the *condor\_startd* daemon
    which is publishing this machine ClassAd. When using CCB,
    *condor\_shared\_port*, and/or an additional private network
    interface, that information will be included here as well.
 MyType:
    The ClassAd type; always set to the literal string "Machine".
 Name:
    The name of this resource; typically the same value as the Machine
    attribute, but could be customized by the site administrator. On SMP
    machines, the *condor\_startd* will divide the CPUs up into separate
    slots, each with with a unique name. These names will be of the form
    “slot#@full.hostname”, for example, “slot1@vulture.cs.wisc.edu”,
    which signifies slot number 1 from vulture.cs.wisc.edu.
 Offline<name>:
    A string that lists specific instances of a user-defined machine
    resource, identified by name. Each instance is currently unavailable
    for purposes of match making.
 OfflineUniverses:
    A ClassAd list that specifies which job universes are presently
    offline, both as strings and as the corresponding job universe
    number. Could be used the the startd to refuse to start jobs in
    offline universes:

    ::

        START = OfflineUniverses is undefined || (! member( JobUniverse, OfflineUniverses ))

    May currently only contain "VM" and 13.

    in the last twenty minutes.
 RecentJobRankPreemptions:
    The total number of times a running job has been preempted on this
    machine due to the machine’s rank of jobs in the last twenty
    minutes.
 RecentJobStarts:
    The total number of jobs which have been started on this machine in
    the last twenty minutes.
 RecentJobUserPrio:
    The total number of times a running job has been preempted on this

 Requirements:
    A boolean, which when evaluated within the context of the machine
    ClassAd and a job ClassAd, must evaluate to TRUE before HTCondor
    will allow the job to use this machine.
 RetirementTimeRemaining:
    An integer number of seconds after MyCurrentTime when the running
    job can be evicted. MaxJobRetirementTime is the expression of how
    much retirement time the machine offers to new jobs, whereas
    RetirementTimeRemaining is the negotiated amount of time remaining
    for the current running job. This may be less than the amount
    offered by the machine’s MaxJobRetirementTime expression, because
    the job may ask for less.
 SingularityVersion:
    A string containing the version of Singularity available, if the
    machine being advertised supports running jobs within a Singularity
    container (see HasSingularity).
 SlotID:
    For SMP machines, the integer that identifies the slot. The value
    will be X for the slot with

    ::

        name="slotX@full.hostname"

    For non-SMP machines with one slot, the value will be 1.

 SlotType:
    For SMP machines with partitionable slots, the partitionable slot
    will have this attribute set to "Partitionable", and all dynamic
    slots will have this attribute set to "Dynamic".
 SlotWeight:
    This specifies the weight of the slot when calculating usage,
    computing fair shares, and enforcing group quotas. For example,
    claiming a slot with SlotWeight = 2 is equivalent to claiming two
    SlotWeight = 1 slots. See the description of SlotWeight on
    page \ `678 <ConfigurationMacros.html#x33-1950003.5.8>`__.
 StartdIpAddr:
    String with the IP and port address of the *condor\_startd* daemon
    which is publishing this machine ClassAd. When using CCB,
    *condor\_shared\_port*, and/or an additional private network
    interface, that information will be included here as well.
 State:
    String which publishes the machine’s HTCondor state. Can be:

     "Owner":
        The machine owner is using the machine, and it is unavailable to
        HTCondor.
     "Unclaimed":
        The machine is available to run HTCondor jobs, but a good match
        is either not available or not yet found.
     "Matched":
        The HTCondor central manager has found a good match for this
        resource, but an HTCondor scheduler has not yet claimed it.
     "Claimed":
        The machine is claimed by a remote *condor\_schedd* and is
        probably running a job.
     "Preempting":
        An HTCondor job is being preempted (possibly via checkpointing)
        in order to clear the machine for either a higher priority job
        or because the machine owner wants the machine back.
     "Drained":
        This slot is not accepting jobs, because the machine is being
        drained.

 TargetType:
    Describes what type of ClassAd to match with. Always set to the
    string literal "Job", because machine ClassAds always want to be
    matched with jobs, and vice-versa.
 TotalCondorLoadAvg:
    The load average contributed by HTCondor summed across all slots on
    the machine, either from remote jobs or running benchmarks.
 TotalCpus:
    The number of CPUs (cores) that are on the machine. This is in
    contrast with Cpus, which is the number of CPUs in the slot.
 TotalDisk:
    The quantity of disk space in KiB available across the machine (not
    the slot). For partitionable slots, where there is one partitionable
    slot per machine, this value will be the same as machine ClassAd
    attribute TotalSlotDisk.
 TotalLoadAvg:
    A floating point number representing the current load average summed
    across all slots on the machine.
 TotalMachineDrainingBadput:
    The total job runtime in cpu-seconds that has been lost due to job
    evictions caused by draining since this *condor\_startd* began
    executing. In this calculation, it is assumed that jobs are evicted
    without checkpointing.
 TotalMachineDrainingUnclaimedTime:
    The total machine-wide time in cpu-seconds that has not been used
    (i.e. not matched to a job submitter) due to draining since this
    *condor\_startd* began executing.
 TotalMemory:
    The quantity of RAM in MiB available across the machine (not the
    slot). For partitionable slots, where there is one partitionable
    slot per machine, this value will be the same as machine ClassAd
    attribute TotalSlotMemory.
 TotalSlotCpus:
    The number of CPUs (cores) in this slot. For static slots, this
    value will be the same as in Cpus.
 TotalSlotDisk:
    The quantity of disk space in KiB given to this slot. For static
    slots, this value will be the same as machine ClassAd attribute
    Disk. For partitionable slots, where there is one partitionable slot
    per machine, this value will be the same as machine ClassAd
    attribute TotalDisk.
 TotalSlotMemory:
    The quantity of RAM in MiB given to this slot. For static slots,
    this value will be the same as machine ClassAd attribute Memory. For
    partitionable slots, where there is one partitionable slot per
    machine, this value will be the same as machine ClassAd attribute
    TotalMemory.

In addition, there are a few attributes that are automatically inserted
into the machine ClassAd whenever a resource is in the Claimed state:

 ClientMachine:
    The host name of the machine that has claimed this resource
 RemoteAutoregroup:
    A boolean attribute which is True if this resource was claimed via
    negotiation when the configuration variable GROUP\_AUTOREGROUP is
    True. It is False otherwise.
 RemoteGroup:
    The accounting group name corresponding to the submitter that
    claimed this resource.
 RemoteNegotiatingGroup:
    The accounting group name under which this resource negotiated when
    it was claimed. This attribute will frequently be the same as
    attribute RemoteGroup, but it may differ in cases such as when
    configuration variable GROUP\_AUTOREGROUP is True, in which case it
    will have the name of the root group, identified as <none>.
 RemoteOwner:
    The name of the user who originally claimed this resource.
 RemoteUser:
    The name of the user who is currently using this resource. In
    general, this will always be the same as the RemoteOwner, but in
    some cases, a resource can be claimed by one entity that hands off
    the resource to another entity which uses it. In that case,
    RemoteUser would hold the name of the entity currently using the
    resource, while RemoteOwner would hold the name of the entity that
    claimed the resource.
 PreemptingOwner:
    The name of the user who is preempting the job that is currently
    running on this resource.
 PreemptingUser:
    The name of the user who is preempting the job that is currently
    running on this resource. The relationship between PreemptingUser
    and PreemptingOwner is the same as the relationship between
    RemoteUser and RemoteOwner.
 PreemptingRank:
    A float which represents this machine owner’s affinity for running
    the HTCondor job which is waiting for the current job to finish or
    be preempted. If not currently hosting an HTCondor job,
    PreemptingRank is undefined. When a machine is claimed and there is
    already a job running, the attribute’s value is computed by
    evaluating the machine’s Rank expression with respect to the
    preempting job’s ClassAd.
 TotalClaimRunTime:
    A running total of the amount of time (in seconds) that all jobs
    (under the same claim) ran (have spent in the Claimed/Busy state).
 TotalClaimSuspendTime:
    A running total of the amount of time (in seconds) that all jobs
    (under the same claim) have been suspended (in the Claimed/Suspended
    state).
 TotalJobRunTime:
    A running total of the amount of time (in seconds) that a single job
    ran (has spent in the Claimed/Busy state).
 TotalJobSuspendTime:
    A running total of the amount of time (in seconds) that a single job
    has been suspended (in the Claimed/Suspended state).

There are a few attributes that are only inserted into the machine
ClassAd if a job is currently executing. If the resource is claimed but
no job are running, none of these attributes will be defined.

 JobId:
    The job’s identifier (for example, 152.3), as seen from *condor\_q*
    on the submitting machine.
 JobStart:
    The time stamp in integer seconds of when the job began executing,
    since the Unix epoch (00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1, 1970). For idle machines,
    the value is UNDEFINED.
 LastPeriodicCheckpoint:
    If the job has performed a periodic checkpoint, this attribute will
    be defined and will hold the time stamp of when the last periodic
    checkpoint was begun. If the job has yet to perform a periodic
    checkpoint, or cannot checkpoint at all, the LastPeriodicCheckpoint
    attribute will not be defined.

There are a few attributes that are applicable to machines that are
offline, that is, hibernating.

 MachineLastMatchTime:
    The Unix epoch time when this offline ClassAd would have been
    matched to a job, if the machine were online. In addition, the slot1
    ClassAd of a multi-slot machine will have
    slot<X>\_MachineLastMatchTime defined, where <X> is replaced by the
    slot id of each of the slots with MachineLastMatchTime defined.
 Offline:
    A boolean value, that when True, indicates this machine is in an
    offline state in the *condor\_collector*. Such ClassAds are stored
    persistently, such that they will continue to exist after the
    *condor\_collector* restarts.
 Unhibernate:
    A boolean expression that specifies when a hibernating machine
    should be woken up, for example, by *condor\_rooster*.

For machines with user-defined or custom resource specifications,
including GPUs, the following attributes will be in the ClassAd for each
slot. In the name of the attribute, <name> is substituted with the
configured name given to the resource.

 Assigned<name>:
    A space separated list that identifies which of these resources are
    currently assigned to slots.
 Offline<name>:
    A space separated list that indicates which of these resources is
    unavailable for match making.
 Total<name>:
    An integer quantity of the total number of these resources.

For machines with custom resource specifications that include GPUs, the
following attributes may be in the ClassAd for each slot, depending on
the value of configuration variable MACHINE\_RESOURCE\_INVENTORY\_GPUs
and what GPUs are detected. In the name of the attribute, <name> is
substituted with the *prefix string* assigned for the GPU.
