=============

ClassAd attributes vary, depending on the entity producing the ClassAd.
Therefore, each ClassAd has an attribute named MyType, which describes
the type of ClassAd. In addition, the *condor\_collector* appends
attributes to any daemon’s ClassAd, whenever the *condor\_collector* is
queried. These additional attributes are listed in the unnumbered
subsection labeled ClassAd Attributes Added by the *condor\_collector*
on
page \ `2469 <ClassAdAttributesAddedbytheCondorcollector.html#x178-1242000A.10>`__.

Here is a list of defined values for MyType, as well as a reference to a
list attributes relevant to that type.

 Job
    Each submitted job describes its state, for use by the
    *condor\_negotiator* daemon in finding a machine upon which to run
    the job. ClassAd attributes that appear in a job ClassAd are listed
    and described in the unnumbered subsection labeled Job ClassAd
    Attributes on
    page \ `2351 <JobClassAdAttributes.html#x170-1234000A.2>`__.
 Machine
    Each machine in the pool (and hence, the *condor\_startd* daemon
    running on that machine) describes its state. ClassAd attributes
    that appear in a machine ClassAd are listed and described in the
    unnumbered subsection labeled Machine ClassAd Attributes on
    page \ `2397 <MachineClassAdAttributes.html#x171-1235000A.3>`__.
 DaemonMaster
    Each *condor\_master* daemon describes its state. ClassAd attributes
    that appear in a DaemonMaster ClassAd are listed and described in
    the unnumbered subsection labeled DaemonMaster ClassAd Attributes on
    page \ `2426 <DaemonMasterClassAdAttributes.html#x172-1236000A.4>`__.
 Scheduler
    Each *condor\_schedd* daemon describes its state. ClassAd attributes
    that appear in a Scheduler ClassAd are listed and described in the
    unnumbered subsection labeled Scheduler ClassAd Attributes on
    page \ `2429 <SchedulerClassAdAttributes.html#x173-1237000A.5>`__.
 Negotiator
    Each *condor\_negotiator* daemon describes its state. ClassAd
    attributes that appear in a Negotiator ClassAd are listed and
    described in the unnumbered subsection labeled Negotiator ClassAd
    Attributes on
    page \ `2448 <NegotiatorClassAdAttributes.html#x174-1238000A.6>`__.
 Submitter
    Each submitter is described by a ClassAd. ClassAd attributes that
    appear in a Submitter ClassAd are listed and described in the
    unnumbered subsection labeled Submitter ClassAd Attributes on
    page \ `2453 <SubmitterClassAdAttributes.html#x175-1239000A.7>`__.
 Defrag
    Each *condor\_defrag* daemon describes its state. ClassAd attributes
    that appear in a Defrag ClassAd are listed and described in the
    unnumbered subsection labeled Defrag ClassAd Attributes on
    page \ `2456 <DefragClassAdAttributes.html#x176-1240000A.8>`__.
 Collector
    Each *condor\_collector* daemon describes its state. ClassAd
    attributes that appear in a Collector ClassAd are listed and
    described in the unnumbered subsection labeled Collector ClassAd
    Attributes on
    page \ `2460 <CollectorClassAdAttributes.html#x177-1241000A.9>`__.
 Query

In addition, statistics are published for each DaemonCore daemon. These
attributes are listed and described in the unnumbered subsection labeled
DaemonCore Statistics Attributes on
page \ `2471 <DaemonCoreStatisticsAttributes.html#x179-1243000A.11>`__.
